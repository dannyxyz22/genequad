#this page details how to use bioruby in order to import data from pubmed articles

= Introduction =

Some more information is needed to be retrieved from the geneRIFs: pubMed articles. As geneRIFs point to the pubMedIDs of articles that describe their functions, some data was obtained from NCBI. 

According to Dr. Simon:
 "For each of the GeneRIF, there is a corresponding pubMed article (indicated by pmID). Using the pmID, we can retrieve the pubMed abstract and related information.
 
 At this moment, I am more interested in getting which year was the article published. The publication date can be retrieved by the esummary utility"

esummary utility is described in this address: http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/esummary_help.html

In order to retrieve the data some help from Dr. Kibbe was given: ruby scripts!

= Procedures =

Data from esummary utility can be retrieved accessing an URL like this:
http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esummary.fcgi?db=pubmed&id=16609366&retmode=xml

Instead of writing some script code to retrieve and parse urls like that, a faster approach was used. TODO: describe bioruby
