#summary this page details how to find out which genes had a significant change in rank along the years

= Introduction =

A key information that may be retrieved from imported databases is which genes have had some importance increase along the last years. After testing several ways to detect these genes, a simple approach was made, based on the percentage of geneRIFs that were published about each gene, according to the related pubMed article.


= Procedures =

Firstly, geneRIF (ImportingGenerif) and pubMed (ImportingPubMed) databases were imported to the same _gene.db_ file. One might notice that each geneRIF points to a pubMed article that describes the geneRIF in more detail. The publication date of this article was used to retrieve information on which year the geneRIF was being studied. This way, the number of geneRIFs about each gene were counted, classified by year. 

In order to get the number of geneRIFs, by year, the following SQL query was used:

{{{
select geneID, count(*) as number from generif,pubmed where taxID=9606 and generif.pmID = pubmed.pmID and pubDate like '2006%' group by geneID order by number DESC;
}}}

This query obtains the counts for the year 2006. The output of this query looks like this:

{{{
(geneID | number of generifs for that year):
7157|290
192343|192
7124|136
7422|128

7040|109
5743|108
4790|86
