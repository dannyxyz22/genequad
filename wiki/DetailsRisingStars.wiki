#summary this page details how to find out which genes had a significant change in rank along the years

= Introduction =

A key information that may be retrieved from imported databases is which genes have had some importance increase along the last years. After testing several ways to detect these genes, a simple approach was made, based on the percentage of geneRIFs that were published about each gene, according to the related pubMed article.


= Procedures =

Firstly, geneRIF ( ImportingGenerif ) and pubMed (ImportingPubMed) were imported.
