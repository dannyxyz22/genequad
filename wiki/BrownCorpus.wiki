== Formula == 

The formula used to calculate BrownRatio was:

ratio = termFrequency_in_document / (BROWNCONSTANT + brownFrequency)

And BROWNCONSTANT was defined as 100. 


== Code == 

A couple functions were added to termWeighter.cpp

{{{
void loadBrownCorpus(){
  FILE* brownFile = fopen("brown_freq.txt","r");
  char word[200];
  int wordFreq;
  while( fscanf(brownFile,"%s %d",word,&wordFreq) !=EOF ){
    string sWord = (string)word;
    brown[makeLower(sWord)]=wordFreq;
  }
}
void calculateBrownRatios(){
  map<int, map<string,int> >::iterator git;
  for(git = geneIDwordFrequency.begin();git!=geneIDwordFrequency.end();git++){
    map<string,double> termRatioMap;
    vector<termSort> termVector;
    
    map<string,int>::iterator wit;
    for(wit = (*git).second.begin();wit != (*git).second.end(); wit++){
      string term = (*wit).first;
      int termFrequency = (*wit).second;
      int brownFrequency = 0;
      if( brown.find(term) != brown.end()){
	brownFrequency = brown[term];
      }
      double ratio = (double) termFrequency / (BROWNCONSTANT + brownFrequency);
      termRatioMap[term] = ratio;
      termSort temp;
      temp.word = term;
      temp.weight = termRatioMap[term];
      termVector.push_back(temp);      
    }	
    sort(termVector.begin(),termVector.end());
    printf("Gene %d\n",(*git).first);
    for(int i=0;i<termVector.size();i++){
      printf("%-20s %5.3lf\n",termVector[i].word.c_str(),termVector[i].weight);
    }
  }      
}
}}}
