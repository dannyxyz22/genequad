= Importing GeneRIF database to sqlite =

To get started on the project, let us first import the GeneRIF into a
database.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/GeneRIF/
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/

SQLite is preferred, because we have other projects using it, so later they
can be easily integrated.
http://www.sqlite.org/

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,

Simon
